# Handle-Hijacking-Anti-Cheat-Bypass
This is a Anti-Cheat bypass written in c++ by Apxaey, and makes use of Microsoft's undocumented Native API. I tested this specifically on VAC, however it should bypass any other usermode anticheats. Using this with unique code, should ensure you stay undetected by user-mode anti-cheats such as VAC.. I have provided a YouTube tutorial on how to make this software which i highly recommend you watch.To use this bypass, include the files in your vs project and call the hijack handle function and provide the handle you want to recieve the stolen/hijacked handle.
